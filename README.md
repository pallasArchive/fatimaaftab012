# 🌙 hi, i’m fatima  

> quietly chasing galaxies in code and equations.

## about me  
- 📖 happiest when reading — from percy jackson adventures to marvel multiverse chaos.  
- ✨ drawn to the in-betweens of theory and reality: how equations become experiments.  
- 🎥 a soft spot for stories that keep you guessing — psychological thrillers, quiet sci-fi, and a little star wars.  
- 🪐 fascinated by cosmology, supersymmetry, and the physics of the early universe.  
- 🎶 i am the sum of my sounds — [the acropolis didn’t collapse for this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/22s2VwYJR3D2QD4KpyrbuW?si=35215a8398b4464e).  

## what i’m exploring  
- **theoretical & computational physics** — cosmological model analysis, quantum field theory, SUSY frameworks.  
- **research projects**:  
  - *SUSY Hybrid Inflation in GUTs* — presented at the RSO 21st Century International Science Conference, published in RWU’s *Book of Abstracts*.  
  - *EEPROM Photogrammetry* — experimental concept for muon beam imaging (CERN BL4S).  
  - *crystal growth in microgravity* — methodology proposal for reduced-gravity crystallization studies.  
- learning to blend physics with programming to make the unseen, seen.  

## tools i keep close  
`Python` (NumPy | Pandas | Matplotlib) | `C++` | Power BI | LaTeX | Visual Studio | PyCharm
